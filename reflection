## Reflection

One challenging part of feature engineering was handling categorical variables. 
Using one-hot encoding significantly increased the number of features, which can 
increase model complexity.

Creating the age group feature helped simplify age into meaningful categories, 
which may improve interpretability. However, binning can also reduce precision 
since it removes detailed numeric variation.

My model achieved moderate accuracy. With more tuning (feature scaling, 
regularization adjustments, or trying RandomForest), performance could improve.

Next time, I would experiment with feature scaling and cross-validation 
to better optimize performance.
